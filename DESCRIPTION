Description: R Scripts and functions use to 
             1. create gene expression model integrating prior information on variants, 
             2. impute gene expression on genotype-only datasets, build individual gene T-scores and Pathway-scores and perform association with phenotype of interest, 
             3. perform clustering of cases based on imputed gene expression and validate on additional phenotypes/treatment response and pathway activity.
