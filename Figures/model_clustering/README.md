# Cases stratification based on imputed gene expression
CASTom-iGEx (Module 3) is a command-line tool that uses gene-level T-scores scaled by their association with trait of interest to cluster patients using a graph-based clustering technique. These groups are then tested for association with endophenotype differences and genes/pathway scores as well as group-specific treatment response when data available. If no clinical information are present, plausible differences in endophenotypes are detected with the approximation of gene risk-scores. Two versions are available dependening of data structure (single or multiple cohorts).
