An example of running the main part of CASTom pipeline, which includes:
- Imputation of gene expression based on a reference PriLer model for GTEx Brain Cortex using synthetic genetic data
- Calculation of T-scores and pathway scores for pathways from Reactome and GO databases
- Test for the association between the scores from the previous step and a surrogate diagnosis

For more information on each of the steps and the usage parameters, see README in https://github.com/zillerlab/CASTom-iGEx/tree/master/Software/model_prediction
